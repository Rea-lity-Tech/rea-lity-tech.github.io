## [Skatolo](https://rea-lity-tech.github.io/Skatolo/)

Skatolo is a fork of ControlP5. We repackaged the code and reworked the pointer system to enable multi-touch inputs. We add dedicated widgets and 
controllers for our apps and for Augmented Reality. 

# Experimental programs

Here are the one-user programs made for fun and work. 

## Presention software: [Soby](https://github.com/poqudrof/Soby)

Soby was inspired by Prezi and Sozi. It is a planar (zoomable) presentation software. 
The presentations are created with Inkscape, animated with a plugin from Sozi and displayed through Processing. 

It is an experimental project which enables to mix creative coding and presention softwares. 

Soby is in Ruby, and uses [JRubyArt](https://github.com/ruby-processing/JRubyArt).  


# Contributions

## [Robus in Ruby](https://github.com/Rea-lity-Tech/RobusRuby) 

[Robus](https://github.com/pollen/pyrobus) is a robotics framework from [Pollen Robotics](http://pollen-robotics.com/). 
We created an experimental version of Robus in Ruby to make it work in JRubyArt.
